üß± OSI Model: 7 Layers
Layer	Name	Function	Protocols / Examples	Devices
7	Application	End-user interface, provides network services to apps	HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, Telnet, SSH	Web browser, email client
6	Presentation	Data format translation, encryption, compression	SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG, ASCII, EBCDIC	(Part of software stack)
5	Session	Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications	NetBIOS, RPC, PPTP	(Managed in software)
4	Transport	Reliable data transport, segmentation, flow control, error handling	TCP, UDP	‚Äî
3	Network	Routing, addressing, logical paths	IP, ICMP, IPSec, ARP, RIP, OSPF, BGP	Router
2	Data Link	Frames, MAC addressing, error detection	Ethernet, PPP, Switch protocols, MAC	Switch, Bridge
1	Physical	Transmission of raw bit stream over physical medium	Cables, RJ45, Fiber, Hubs, Electrical signals	Hub, NIC, Cables

üîç Simple Real-World Analogy: Sending a Letter
Layer 7 (Application): You write the message.

Layer 6 (Presentation): You translate it into a common language and encrypt it.

Layer 5 (Session): You start the conversation ("Hi, let‚Äôs talk").

Layer 4 (Transport): You ensure it gets delivered in order and reliably.

Layer 3 (Network): You choose the best postal route.

Layer 2 (Data Link): You address the envelope with sender and receiver.

Layer 1 (Physical): You hand it over to the postman to physically deliver it.
